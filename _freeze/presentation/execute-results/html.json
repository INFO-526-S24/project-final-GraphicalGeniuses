These datasets offer a comprehensive view of their contributions across various seasons, competitions, matches, and events.\n\n    -   `ronaldo.csv`: It has 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 701 rows indicating the 701 goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo up until 2022.\n\n    -   `messi.csv`: It has the same 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 698 rows indicating the 698 goals scored by Lionel Messi up until 2022.\n:::\n\n## Approach {.smaller}\n\n::: incremental\n-   First, we created animations using gganimate. It shows the world map highlighting countries where Messi and Ronaldo scored goals for a particular year over the period from 2005 to 2022. It also displays total number of goals scored by each player in all matches in that year\n\n-   Then, using CSS, HTML we created comparison plots between Messi and Ronaldo's scores which can be filtered and displayed based on various factors like Country, Competition, Opponent, Match Day, Last Minute Goals.\n:::\n\n# The Legacy: Ronaldo Vs Messi\n\n## Animations\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Animations\n\n## Discussion\n\n::: incremental\n-   In year 2012 Messi scored highest goals of 74 whereas in 2013, Ronaldo scored highest goals of 58.\n\n-   Both players scored higher goals compared to the other for 8 years each.\n\n-   Messi scored higher goals than Ronaldo in years viz. 2009-2010, 2012, 2016-2019, 2022 whereas Ronaldo scored higher than Messi in the years 2005-2008,2013-2015, 2020\n\n-   The total goals scored by Messi in there years are 652 whereas goals scored by Ronaldo in the same period are 654.\n\n-   So the performance of both players looks almost comparable in terms of goals scored with Ronaldo scoring marginally higher total scores than Messi\n:::\n\n# The Rivalry: Ronaldo Vs Messi\n\n## Comparison\n",
