#### **Our High Level Goal**

To compare and contrast the performances of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, only, over time and space (season / country respectively), primarily via geographical plots

#### **Description**

The datasets, compiled by Azmine Toushik Wasi and sourced from Kaggle, provides a detailed insight into the performances of two legendary footballers: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. These datasets offer a comprehensive view of their contributions across various seasons, competitions, matches, and events.

-   `ronaldo.csv`: It has 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 701 rows indicating the 701 goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo up until 2022.

-   `messi.csv`: It has the same 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 698 rows indicating the 698 goals scored by Lionel Messi up until 2022.

These datasets enable detailed analysis and insights into the goal-scoring abilities, match contributions, playing positions, and other crucial aspects of two of football's greatest players.

#### **Why did we choose this dataset?**

Ronaldo and Messi are two of the most iconic and celebrated footballers in the history of the sport. Their performances, achievements, and playing styles have demanded immense interest and attention from football fans worldwide. Since both Messi and Ronaldo have massive fanbases, there is a significant demand for analysis related to their performances. Analyzing these datasets and attempting an educated analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of their playing styles, strengths, and contributions to their respective teams.

The rivalry between Ronaldo and Messi has transcended the football pitch, and this analysis is our attempt to honour the legacy of the two legends who inspired an entire generation to strive for excellence.

#### **First Topic**

The first aim is to craft a side-by-side animation detailing the number of goals scored by both Ronaldo and Messi, plotted geographically over time. The plan is firstly to isolate the unique competitions the two players have participated in; gather the countries in which said competitions are hosted - via the creation of a new variable from literature searches to match competitions to their countries - and then; display said countries, on a world map, and how they changed over seasons. The data of focus will be the `competitions`, a new variable detailing the year in which their goals were scored and a new variable detailing the region in which that competition took place. The time-frame will be from 2005 to 2022.

#### **Second Topic**

The second target is to create an interactive map, giving details about a summary of the goals scored in each country by Ronaldo and Messi. It will allow for comparison and contrasting per country between the two players. A focus will be on highlighting the comparison between the number of goals scored by the two players in an individual region. The variables of focus will be a seasonal sum of the goals scored per regions. The time-frame will also be from 2005 to 2022.

#### **The Data**

The dataset appears to contain information related to football matches, likely from a specific club or league. Here's a breakdown of the columns:

| S.No. | Column Name        | Datatype  | Description                                                                           |

No-Assist NAs will be replaced with "No Assists"
