# The Timeless Rivalry: Ronaldo Vs Messi

Final project repo for INFO 526 - Spring 2024.

# Introduction

The ultimate goal of the project is to compare and contrast the performances of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, only, over time and space (season / country respectively), primarily via geographical plots.

# Datasets

The datasets, compiled by Azmine Toushik Wasi and sourced from Kaggle, provides a detailed insight into the performances of two legendary footballers: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. These datasets offer a comprehensive view of their contributions across various seasons, competitions, matches, and events.

ronaldo.csv: It has 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 701 rows indicating the 701 goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo up until 2022.

messi.csv: It has the same 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 698 rows indicating the 698 goals scored by Lionel Messi up until 2022.

# Primary Objectives

The primary objective is to make a holistic and unbiased comparison between the careers of Ronaldo and Messi.

First, we created animations using gganimate. It shows the world map highlighting countries where Messi and Ronaldo scored goals for a particular year over the period from 2005 to 2022. It also displays total number of goals scored by each player in all matches in that year.

We also made an interactive world map using plotly where we highlighted the countries where both the players reigned and showed their total scores in the countries respectively.

Then, using CSS, HTML we created comparison plots between Messi and Ronaldo's scores which can be filtered and displayed based on various factors like Country, Competition, Opponent, Match Day, Last Minute Goals.
