These datasets offer a comprehensive view of their contributions across various seasons, competitions, matches, and events.\n\nronaldo.csv: It has 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 701 rows indicating the 701 goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo up until 2022.\nmessi.csv: It has the same 13 variables such as season, competition, result, opponent etc. In total, it has 698 rows indicating the 698 goals scored by Lionel Messi up until 2022.\n\nThese datasets enable detailed analysis and insights into the goal-scoring abilities, match contributions, playing positions, and other crucial aspects of two of football’s greatest players.\n\n\nWhy did we choose this dataset?\nRonaldo and Messi are two of the most iconic and celebrated footballers in the history of the sport. Their performances, achievements, and playing styles have demanded immense interest and attention from football fans worldwide. Since both Messi and Ronaldo have massive fanbases, there is a significant demand for analysis related to their performances. Analyzing these datasets and attempting an educated analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of their playing styles, strengths, and contributions to their respective teams.\nThe rivalry between Ronaldo and Messi has transcended the football pitch, and this analysis is our attempt to honour the legacy of the two legends who inspired an entire generation to strive for excellence.\n\n\nFirst Topic\nThe first aim is to craft a side-by-side animation detailing the number of goals scored by both Ronaldo and Messi, plotted geographically over time. The plan is firstly to isolate the unique competitions the two players have participated in; gather the countries in which said competitions are hosted - via the creation of a new variable from literature searches to match competitions to their countries - and then; display said countries, on a world map, and how they changed over seasons. The data of focus will be the competitions, a new variable detailing the year in which their goals were scored and a new variable detailing the region in which that competition took place. The time-frame will be from 2005 to 2022.\n\n\nSecond Topic\nThe second target is to create an interactive map, giving details about a summary of the goals scored in each country by Ronaldo and Messi. It will allow for comparison and contrasting per country between the two players. A focus will be on highlighting the comparison between the number of goals scored by the two players in an individual region. The variables of focus will be a seasonal sum of the goals scored per regions. The time-frame will also be from 2005 to 2022.\n\n\nThe Data\nThe dataset appears to contain information related to football matches, likely from a specific club or league. Here’s a breakdown of the columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS.No.\nColumn Name\nDatatype\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1.\nSeason\nCharacter\nIndicates the season of the competition in which the match took place\n\n\n2.\nCompetition\nCharacter\nSpecifies the name or type of the competition (e.g., league, cup).\n\n\n3.\nMatchday\nCharacter\nIndicates the matchday number within the competition.\n\n\n4.\nDate\nDate\nRepresents the date on which the match was played.\n\n\n5.\nVenue\nCharacter\nSpecifies the location where the match was held.\n\n\n6.\nClub\nCharacter\nRefers to the name of the football club involved in the match.\n\n\n7.\nOpponent\nCharacter\nRefers to the opposing team.\n\n\n8.\nResult\nCharacter\nIndicates the outcome of the match, usually in terms of goals scored by each team.\n\n\n9.\nPlaying_Position\nCharacter\nSpecifies the position played by the player.\n\n\n10.\nMinute\nInteger\nIndicates the minute in which a particular event occurred (e.g., goal, substitution).\n\n\n11.\nAt_score\nCharacter\nRepresents the score at the time of the event.\n\n\n12.\nType\nCharacter\nDescribes the type of event (e.g., goal, assist).\n\n\n13.\nGoal_assist\nCharacter\nIndicates the player who assisted in scoring the goal.\n\n\n\nThe new variable Year will be converted to a datetime object; Minute will be converted to Integer; Season will be converted to PosixCT\nNo-Assist NAs will be replaced with “No Assists”\n\n\nThe Datasets\n\n\nCode\nronaldoTop &lt;- head(ronaldo)\nmessiTop &lt;- head(messi)\n\n\nronaldoTop %&gt;%gt() %&gt;%\ntab_header(title = \"Cristiano Ronaldo\") %&gt;%\n  \ntab_style(\n  style = list(cell_fill(color = \"#fff0ef\"),\n  cell_text(weight = \"bold\")),\nlocations = cells_body(columns = Competition)) %&gt;% \n  \ntab_style(\n  style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\"),\n  locations = cells_column_labels()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Cristiano Ronaldo\n    \n    \n    \n      Season\n      Competition\n      Matchday\n      Date\n      Venue\n      Club\n      Opponent\n      Result\n      Playing_Position\n      Minute\n      At_score\n      Type\n      Goal_assist\n    \n  \n  \n    02/03\nLiga Portugal\n6\n10-07-02\nH\nSporting CP\nMoreirense FC\n3:00\nLW\n34\n2:00\nSolo run\nNA\n    02/03\nLiga Portugal\n6\n10-07-02\nH\nSporting CP\nMoreirense FC\n3:00\nLW\n90+5\n3:00\nHeader\nRui Jorge\n    02/03\nLiga Portugal\n8\n10/26/02\nA\nSporting CP\nBoavista FC\n1:02\nNA\n88\n1:02\nRight-footed shot\nCarlos Martins\n    02/03\nTaca de Portugal Placard\nFourth Round\n11/24/02\nH\nSporting CP\nCD Estarreja\n4:01\nNA\n67\n3:00\nLeft-footed shot\nCesar Prates\n    02/03\nTaca de Portugal Placard\nFifth Round\n12/18/02\nH\nSporting CP\nFC Oliveira do Hospital\n8:01\nNA\n13\n3:00\nNA\nNA\n    03/04\nPremier League\n11\n11-01-03\nH\nManchester United\nPortsmouth FC\n3:00\nRW\n80\n2:00\nDirect free kick\nNA\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nmessiTop %&gt;%gt() %&gt;%\ntab_header(title = \"Lionel Messi\") %&gt;%\n  \ntab_style(\n  style = list(cell_fill(color = \"#b2f7ef\"),\n  cell_text(weight = \"bold\")),\nlocations = cells_body(columns = Competition)) %&gt;% \n  \ntab_style(\n  style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\"),\n  locations = cells_column_labels()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Lionel Messi\n    \n    \n    \n      Season\n      Competition\n      Matchday\n      Date\n      Venue\n      Club\n      Opponent\n      Result\n      Playing_Position\n      Minute\n      At_score\n      Type\n      Goal_assist\n    \n  \n  \n    04/05\nLaLiga\n34\n05-01/05\nH\nFC Barcelona\nAlbacete Balompie\n2:00\nCF\n90+1\n2:00\nLeft-footed shot\nRonaldinho Gaacho\n    05/06\nUEFA Champions League\nGroup Stage\n11-02/05\nH\nFC Barcelona\nPanathinaikos Athens\n5:00\nRW\n34\n3:00\nLeft-footed shot\nNA\n    05/06\nLaLiga\n13\n11/27/05\nH\nFC Barcelona\nRacing Santander\n4:01\nRW\n51\n2:00\nLeft-footed shot\nSamuel Etoo\n    05/06\nLaLiga\n19\n1/15/06\nH\nFC Barcelona\nAthletic Bilbao\n2:01\nRW\n50\n2:01\nLeft-footed shot\nMark van Bommel\n    05/06\nLaLiga\n20\n1/22/06\nH\nFC Barcelona\nDeportivo Alaves\n2:00\nCF\n82\n2:00\nLeft-footed shot\nRonaldinho Gaacho\n    05/06\nLaLiga\n21\n1/29/06\nA\nFC Barcelona\nRCD Mallorca\n0:03\nCF\n75\n0:02\nRight-footed shot\nSylvinho\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Weekly Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Name\nStatus\nAssignee\nDue\nPriority\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nCreate the proposal\nPending\n\n03 April\nHigh\nCreate the initial documented proposal\n\n\nCreate the Git Repo\nPending\n\n03 April\nModerate\nCreate a new repository for data\n\n\nResubmit proposal\nPending\n\n08 April\nHigh\nResubmit revised proposal\n\n\nData wrangling\nPending\n\n08 April\nModerate\nInitial exploration and cleaning of the datasets\n\n\nAnalysis of topic one\nPending\n\n15 April\nModerate\n\n\n\nAnalysis of topic two\nPending\n\n22 April\nLow\n\n\n\nPlotting for topic one\nPending\n\n29 April\nLow\n\n\n\nPlotting for topic two\nPending\n\n29 April\nLow\n\n\n\nSummarising of information\nPending\n\n01 May\nLow\n\n\n\nWrite up\nPending\n\n06 May\nLow\n\n\n\nPresentation\nPending\n\n06 May\nLow\n\n\n\nFinal organisation\nPending\n\n06 May\nLow\n\n\n\nSite publishing\nPending\n\n06 May\nLow\n\n\n\nFinal submission\nPending\n\n06 May\nLow\nFinal submission of the entire repository"
